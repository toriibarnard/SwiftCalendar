1) Ty is meant to help people with their schedule, The MAIN purpose of Ty, is for people to ask ty when the best times for them to do flexible tasks (go to the gym, go for a run, things that you can choose when to do), and ty analyzes the schedule, taking in all the fixed events (work, practice, meetings, appointments, things that you cant choose when to do) and helps the user find the best time possible. the secondary purpose of Ty is to automate the calendar creation process for users, users dont have to create events for every day of the month, and instead can say "I work 8:30-4 on weekdays" and ty will automatically populate the event on all necessary days. The target user is ANYONE who needs help optimizing their schedule. 2) Ty should always be able to understand what a user is asking, and be able to break down events into start time, end time, the type of event it is, and the title of the event. Ty does not have to handle complex logic like travel time between locations, we can maybe add this in the future. It would definitely help for Ty to learn user patterns over time, but not a necessity - if it's too complicated then it can wait for future implementations. 3) Ty's peronality should be professional assistant, and should always be descriptive. 4) Ty doesn't have to integrate with other calendars, we can maybe add this in the future. Ty doesn't have to handle invitations, shared calendars or team scheduling, or be aware of location (besides for timezones). 5) Ty SHOULD suggest better times when conflicts arise, Ty does not have to have reminders - we can maybe add this in the future. 6) When Ty doesn't understand something, it should ask clarifying questions, if he chooses to make best guesses, he should suggest the guess to the user for the user to then confirm rather than just implementing the change independently. 7) the AI should remember user preferences across sessions, and it should get smarter about specific scheduling patterns.
